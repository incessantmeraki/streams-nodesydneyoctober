# What is node.js ?

 Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

---

# What actually is node.js ?

I/O interface

---
# What does that mean ?

Helps write program in JavaScript that talks to 

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li> Network </li>
    <li> File System </li>
    <li> other I/O </li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

# I/O sources

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li> Databases (MySQL, Redis, CouchDB...) </li>
    <li> APIs (Facebook, Twitter, Youtube ...) </li>
    <li> HTTP/WebSocket connections </li>
    <li> Files </li> 
  </Appear>
</ul>

# Comon thing for all I/O ?

<Appear>
  <h2 style={{color: 'red'}}> Data </h2>
</Appear>

---

# ðŸ¤”

<Appear>
  <h2> If it is all about data, then   </h2>
  <h2> There must be some good way to handle data  </h2>
</Appear>

---

## This is where ðŸ‘‰	Stream ðŸ‘ˆ	 comes into the picture

---

# What is Stream ?

## Stream is a handy abstraction that's there in node.js to manipulate data

---

# Is Stream a new concept ? 
<Appear>
  <h2> No it isn't </h2>
</Appear>

---
##  Been there since the days of UNIX in form of pipe

<br/> 

```sh
  $ cat file | wc -c
```

---

# Why Streams ?

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li><h2>Handling large amount of data in limited resource </h2> </li>
    <li><h2>Compose decoupled applications using generic abstraction</h2> </li>
  </Appear>
</ul>



---

# Example:  Handling large amount of data

- Serve a large file over HTTP server
- w/o Stream
- with Stream
- See the difference

---

# Types of Stream

- Readable : produces data  
- Writable : consumes data
- Transform : consumes data , modifies it, and produces the modified thing
- Duplex : produces and consumes data separately. Similar to telephone

---

# Pipe

## used to connect different streams 
- Readable : ``` readable.pipe(X) ```
- Writeable : ``` X.pipe(writeable) ```
- Transform : ``` X.pipe(transform).pipe(Y) ```
- Duplex : ``` X.pipe(duplex).pipe(X) ```

---

# Readable Stream Methods

- ``` stream.on('readable', callback) ```
- ``` stream.on('end' ,callback) ```
- ``` stream.on('data', callback) ```
- ``` stream.read() ```
- ``` stream.pipe(writeableStream) ```


---

# Flow mode v/s Pull mode

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li> Two types of mode readable stream operates </li>
    <li> Difference ? Backpressure </li>
       <ul> <li>If receiving end can't handle the pace of sender, data clogs up </li> </ul>
    <li> Default : pull based mode </li>
    <li> Use stream.resume() or stream.on('data, callback) to enable flow mode </li>
    <li> Suggestion: use .pipe() </li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

---

# Writeable Stream Methods

- ``` stream.write(data) ```
- ``` stream.on('finish', callback) ```
- ``` stream.end(), stream.end(data) ```
- ``` x.pipe(stream) ```

---

# Example: Exploring common methods available

- Create Readable and Writeable Stream to files
- Use methods shown below to read and write data 

---

# Built-in streams

- ## process
- ## http
- ## zlib
- ## crypto

---

# Examples:

---

## process

```js
  stdin //readable stream
  stdout //writeable stream
```

---

## http 

```js
http.createServer(function(req,res) {...})
// req = readable stream and res = writeable stream

http.request(opts, function(res){...})
//res = readable stream

```
---

## zlib

```js
  var zlib = require('zlib')

  zlib.createGzip(opts) // transform stream to compress with gzip
  zlib.createGunzip(opts) // transform stream to uncompress with gzip
  zlib.createDeflate(opts) // transform stream to compress with deflate
  zlib.createDeflateRaw(opts) // transform stream to compress with raw deflate
  zlib.createInflate(opts) // transform stream to uncompress with deflate
  zlib.createInflateRaw(opts) // transform stream to uncompress with raw deflate
  zlib.createUnzip(opts) // transform stream to uncompress gzip and deflate
```

---

## crypto

```js
  var crypto = require('crypto')

  crypto.createCipher(algo, password) // transform stream to encrypt
  crypto.createDecipher(algo, password) // transform stream to decrypt
  crypto.createCipheriv(algo, key, iv) // transform stream to encrypt with iv
  crypto.createDecipheriv(algo, key, iv) // transform stream to decrypt with
   iv
  crypto.createHash(algo) // transform stream to output cryptographic hash
  crypto.createHMAC(algo, key) // transform stream to output HMAC digest
  crypto.createSign(algo) // writable stream to sign messages
  crypto.createVerify(algo) // writable stream to verify signatures
```

---

## TCP

```js
  //Server
  var net = require('net')
  var server = net.createServer(function(stream){})
  server.listen(5000)

  //Client
  net.connect(5000, localhost)
```

---

## Split

```js
var split = require('split2')
var fs = require('fs')

fs.createReadStream('file')
  .pipe(split())
  .pipe(process.stdout)

```

---

# Creating streams

## Use user-land modules to create streams

---

## from2

```js
  var from = require('from2')
  
  var rStream = from(function(size, next) {})
```

---
## to2

```js
  var to =  require('to2')

  var wStream = to2(function(buffer, next) {})
```
---

## through2

```js

var through = require('through2')

var tStream = through(function (buff, enc, next) {...})
```

---

## duplexify

```js

var duplexify = require('duplexify')

// turn writableStream and readableStream into a single duplex stream
var dup = duplexify(writableStream, readableStream)

dup.write('hello world') // will write to writableStream
dup.on('data', function(data) {
  // will read from readableStream
})

```

---

# Miscellaneous Modules

## collect-stream
## end-of-stream
## pumpify
## websocket-stream 

---

## Stream abstraction works on the browser too, **use browserify**
