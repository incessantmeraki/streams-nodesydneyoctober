# What is node.js ?

 Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

---

# What actually is node.js ?

I/O interface

Helps write program that talks to 

- Network
- File System
- other I/O

---

## I/O based sources

- Databases
- APIs
- HTTP/WebSocket connections
- Files

## So, it is mainly about DATA 

ðŸ¤¨

---

## Then, there must be some good way to handle data 

ðŸ¤”

---

## That is where ðŸ‘‰	Stream ðŸ‘ˆ	 comes into the picture

---

## Stream is a handy abstraction that's there in node.js to play with data

---

## Is it something ðŸ†• ? 
ðŸ™…

---
##  Been there since the days of UNIX in form of |(pipe)

<br/> 

```sh
  $ cat file | wc -c
```

---

## Why Streams ?

- Handling large amount of data in limited resource
- Compose decoupled applications using generic abstraction

---

# Demo 1: Handling large amount of data

---

## Types of Stream

- Readable : produces data  
- Writable : consumes data
- Transform : consumes data , modifies it, and produces the modified thing
- Duplex : produces and consumes data separately. Similar to telephone

---

## Pipe

used to connect different streams

- Readable: readable.pipe(X)
- Writeable: X.pipe(writeable)
- Transform: X.pipe(transform).pipe(Y)
- Duplex: X.pipe(duplex).pipe(X)

---

## Common Readable Stream Methods

- stream.on('readable', callback)
- stream.on('end' ,callback)
- stream.on('data', callback)
- stream.read()
- stream.pipe(writeableStream)
- stream.pipe(x)


---

## Flow mode v/s Pull mode

- Two types of mode readable stream operates 
- Difference ? Backpressure
   If receiving end can't handle the pace of sender, data clogs up
- Default : pull based mode 
- Use stream.resume() or stream.on('data, callback) to enable flow mode
- Suggestion: use .pipe() 

---

## Common Writeable Stream Methods

- stream.write(data)
- stream.on('finish', callback)
- stream.end(), stream.end(data)
- x.pipe(stream)

## Demo 2 : Exploring common methods available

---

## Core built-in streams

![](built-in.png)

---

## Examples:


## HTTP 

---

## Zlib

---

## Crypto

---

## TCP

---

## Split

---

## Creating streams

---

## to2

---

## from2

---

## through2

---

## duplexify 

---

## pumpify

---

Code example

```js
var through2 = require('through2')

var transformer = through2(function (chunk, enc, next) {
  next(chunk.toUpperCase())
})

```
